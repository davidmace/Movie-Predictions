Some really simple scrapers and models for predicting movie box office success from basic plot, actor, producer, budget, studio
information. I was working on this to test some clustering models that I didn't include here because they related too closely 
to the war prediction models. Examples.ipynb includes some baseline regression models that I was using to train other Caltech students in 
practical machine learning on this dataset.
